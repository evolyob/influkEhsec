- Does solution support ability to encrypt sensitive data at-rest. What operational / performance impact will this cause? Has this been fully tested in the vendor's environment?
- Support Multi Factor Authentication. (The solution should support Claim based Authentication using SAML 2.0. The solution should be able to woks on the basis of mutual trust relationships between a Service Provider (SP) and multiple Identity Providers (IdP). The solution should be using open and standard protocols for authentication (Open ID, SAML 2.0, OAuth etc.)

### Useability
- What monitoring tools or Solutions available to track system availability, and what are the key performance indicators (KPIs) to be monitored?
- Support for internationalization & localization ?

### Maintainability
- Does solution support ability to backup and restore the services in fully functional condition using standard set of backup tools ?
- Independent Releases - Does solution support ability to release services independently from each other ?
- Logical Layers - Does solution support ability to Layer the system based on areas of concern ?

### Scalability
- Describe the syste's scalability options, including horizontal and vertical scaling, to accommodate increased demand.
- What is the system's resource allocation strategy to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure consistent availability during peak usage ?
- Remove Service - Does solution support ability to remove any defected service instance with no impact on other services ?

### Performance
- Service Provision - Does solution support ability to automatically provision of service instances & infrastructure resources ?
- Reporting usage shouldn’t adversely affect performance of business application

### Auditability
- The solution should be automatized for the user compute, storage, and network resources. The solution should be capable to use caching and content delivery networks.
- Does solution support ability to trace all business operations ?

### Portability
- Does solution support ability to log all DB transactions ?

### Accessability
- Hosting environment - Does solution support ability to use Virtual Machines or Containers, which will help to port the solution between various virtualization / container technology stack ?

### Capacity
- Application work consistently on MS EDGE browser (Browser Based) and other standard browsers ?

### Monitoring
- Does solution support ability to access system health check for availability ?
- Does solution support ability to access performance and transaction details ?

### Load Balancer Support
- System events should be published, monitored and managed, with the ability to send notifications when the solution/components change status not functioning.

### Reliability
- The solution should support/utilize Load Balancers to support the back-end infrastructure components for, auto-scaling, and elastic infrastructure capabilities.
- Please decribe the reliability to recover the solution from Harware or software or components failures with out service Interuption

### Disaster recovery
- The solution should support redundancy, Fault Tolerance, failover, and disaster recovery capabilities.
- What is the disaster recovery plan, and how does it ensure continued availability in case of catastrophic failures or natural disasters?
- What are the Plans for redundancy/failover/High Availability mechanisms to ensure availability with in a Data Center ?
- What are the Plans for redundancy/failover/High Availability mechanisms to ensure availability across Data Centers ?
- What is the system's recovery time objective (RTO), or the maximum allowable downtime in case of a failure? How is it achieved ?

### Backup
- What is the system's recovery point objective (RPO), or the maximum amount of data loss period in case of a failure? How is it achieved ?
- What measures are in place to maintain data integrity and prevent data corruption or loss during components failures or disaster?

### Databases
- Describe the system's backup and restore procedures, including the frequency of backups and testing of the restore process

### Support with SLA
- The solution should support use of databases to store user data, and the database must be reliable, scalable, and secure. The solution should support applying the required data protection controls at the database levels.

### Compliance
- The infrastructure should be backed by a strong support team that can quickly resolve any issues that arise. This includes verifying the availability of support channels, response times, and support SLAs.

  ### Cloud Provider
- The infrastructure should comply with relevant regulations and standards such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2. This includes verifying that the infrastructure is audited regularly and has appropriate controls in place.
